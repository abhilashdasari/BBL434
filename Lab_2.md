# Lab session 2
## This lab is mainly focussed on Regular expression

It is important to learn basic BASH (mainly usage of `grep`, `awk`, `sed` ) for efficient use of Regular expression

To learn bash go through this video (3 hrs) which starts from basic bash [Bash scripting Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7BufAVwDiM "Bash scripting")

To learn Regular expressions `grep`, `awk`, `sed` [grep, awk and sed ]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7BufAVwDiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJG1dETacLI) "Bash scripting")




## Practice questions

1. Search for a restriction digestion enzyme, pick its sequence, find how many times the restriction enzyme sites are present in the E.coli genome

#### Hint
* Download Ecoli genome in fasta format [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=E+coli)
* search using grep
